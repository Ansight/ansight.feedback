# Powerful Android App Testing Insights

Use Ansight to record, replay and analyse sessions for an Android device.

 * ðŸ‘€ Observe the runtime behaviour of your Android device. View, filter and analyse device logs alongside a mirrored screen.
 * ðŸŽ¥ Record the screen and logs while using your device.
 * ðŸ“¼ Replay a device session, viewing its log data sequenced against the devices screen.

Ansight works with all of your existing Android apps:

 * **Zero Configuration:** You do not need to add any SDK's to your codebase for Ansight to capture data.
 * **App Free:** No 3rd party apps need to be installed onto the phone or tablet.
 * **Target Any App:** Ansight can target any kind of app: an app being debugged, an app from the Play Store, or even an app bundled with the phone. If the app is on the device, Ansight can monitor it.
 * **Toolchain Agnostic:** Ansight works with all Android development frameworks. It uses the standard ADB toolchain so it doesn't matter if you use Java, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, Unity, Unreal Engine etc.
 * **Standalone:** Ansight is fully self contained and does not require any developer tools like Android Studio to be installed.
